# Cook&Chat

## During my Microsoft SWE internship, my team of 5 built this Web app! We designed and implemented a globe API, login, signup, recipe card feed, and saved events page for cooking users. 

**Technologies Used: Javascript, React, React Bootstrap, Git, Node.js, HTML, CSS.**

*Please note that the code source is not provided since our app is Microsoft property. However, permission was given to show screenshots of our web app!*

## Problem Statement

Many people do not have the opportunity or the desire to engage with diverse groups of people. This absence of interaction leads to the reinforcement of unnecessary divisions, lack of empathy for others, and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. How might we give these individuals more opportunities to establish genuine and personal connections with people from different backgrounds and experiences to foster a sense of belonging and understanding within and between communities?

## Summary

Do you love to eat? Want to meet new and diverse groups of people through food? Cook&Chat combines culinary exploration and personal connection by allowing you to create, share, and interact with others and their recipes from across the globe, no culinary experience necessary! In an increasingly isolating world, relating to others is made simpler when cast over a universal medium like cuisine. Unlike Airbnb’s Cooking Experiences, EatWith, and traditional recipe websites, Cook&Chat provides anyone the ability to expand their food palate and make genuine global connections, one recipe at a time.

## Customer profile

Cook & Chat’s initial target market are 25-65 year old adults with and without access to interactions with diverse communities.

The goal of our product is to bring different types of people together in an inclusive space. Therefore, the two groups we are choosing to focus on are those who lack access to or choose not to interact with diverse groups of people and those who do have access to diverse groups of people but want to continue to expand their personal connections. We have narrowed down our user group to this demographic to develop a flow of information between those willing and used to interacting with diverse cultures and those lacking similar opportunities. Our platform is designed to bring people of all backgrounds together based on common interests that everyone can relate to, causing our user group to encompass all people that want a place to expand their social interactions with others.

* **Who** - Adults who don’t have access to diverse communities and those who enjoy sharing their culture and food 

* **What** - who don’t always have a platform to relate to others over a universal concept that everyone can relate to and consume 

* **Why** - increased misinformation and personal bias around the world with a lack of interaction between communities different from one another 

* **When** - as needed, when the user desires to consume or produce content   

* **How** - local promotions and a share feature within the app 

**Sandra** is a middle-aged woman who grew up in a small town in Alaska. With a lack of interactions, she may have inadvertently had biases and needed a way to organically interact with a diverse group of people to demystify these misconceptions. When watching a cooking show on Food Network, she wanted to expand her palate from the comfort of her own home. After trying some authentic recipes and cooking with people from across the world, Sandra is delighted by her newfound learnings and global connections with others.  

**Cleo** is a recent college graduate living in her hometown. Cleo had access to a variety of cultures and communities while in college but did not interact with more diverse groups of people for a variety of reasons. She regrets not taking advantage of her opportunity to get to know new people while at school, and now tries to experience other cultures through cooking. Food makes Cleo feel like she understands and can interact with people from many different cultures.   

**Kevin** lives in New York City after moving to the United States from France and loves to experience the variety of cultures through food and cooking. He has learned many recipes from friends and family both in France and in New York since moving. He normally invites people to his house to cook or tries to find authentic new recipes on

## Goals

- Expand the user’s perspective on diverse groups of people. This can be measured by the number of users and posts during release, by interactions between users within the cook together/posts features, or by demographic measurements.

- Provide food related content in an easy-to-use way. This can be measured by the number of views or interactions with recipe posts and overall user reviews.

- Generate genuine personal connections between users. This can be measured by the consistency of interactions between users and customer reviews.

## In scope

* **P0:** As a user, I should be able to create a profile in order to post and interact with other’s posts. 

* **P0:** As a user, I should be able to create a recipe post and post it (on the map – dependent on map implementation) to other’s feed so that I can share my culture through food and personal stories. 

* **P0:** As a user, I should be able to view multiple food posts in feed form on a single page and click on them to see the full post so that I can access a variety of food content. 

* **P0:** As a user, I should be able to view an individual post on a page so that I can interact with other users through posts. 

* **P0:** As a user, I should be able to easily maneuver between all the different features with the help of a navigation bar (maybe at the bottom like Candy Crush) so that I can use the entirety of the app seamlessly. 

* **P0:** As a user, I should be able to view the feed of the cook together feature (front end UX).  

* **P1:** As a user, I should be able to view the app’s map and view the many different pins that represent the posts of different users around the globe. Then, I should be able to click on them and it will direct me to the actual post. 

* **P2:** As a user, I should be able to store and access other users’ content that they post on the web app (back-end database). 

* **P2:** As a user, I should be able to directly message other users outside of the posting interface/comment sections. 

* **P2:** As a desktop user, I should be able to navigate the website seamlessly. 

* **P2:** As a user, I should be able to access specific cook together meetings and sign up/join meetings with others so that I can pursue face to face interactions with other users through zoom-like functionality to be able to cook with others in real time so that I can talk and interact with others in real time. 

## Out of scope

- As a user, I should be able to interact with a variety of culturally significant content such as clothes, dance, etc. so that I can get to know other people based on my passions.

- Expanding the user group beyond people wanting to interact with food.

- As a user, I should be given an algorithmically generated personal list of new recipes and content based on my demonstrated interests so that I interact with content I didn’t even know I would enjoy.

- Gamification to keep users interested

- Notifications to keep users engaged

## Competitor analysis

**Direct competitors:**

- SimplyRecipes.com – One of the most prominent websites for recipe sharing

- Tasty – Instructional videos and recipe sharing website

- AirBnB Cooking Experiences – Virtual and in person opportunities to learn how to cook authentic recipes in small groups. Users pay per experience.

- EatWith – Similar to AirBnB Cooking Experiences, users can join local hosts for online cooking classes, workshops, and events. Users pay per experience.

- Food blogs – Another potential avenue for food sharing and storytelling

**Adjacent/indirect competitors:**

- Facebook/Instagram/Tiktok/You–Food tutorial videos and recipes

- Google Earth/Maps – Similar to our globe UI

- Zoom/Teams – Prominent video conferencing platforms

- Yelp – Reviewing restaurants from around the world

- Peloton – An interesting/similar product for interactive and instructional livestreams

**Non-app competitors:**

- Recipe books

- Cooking classes

**Strengths:**

- Expanding access to interactive culinary and social experiences—other competitors have either limited who the cooking sessions hosts could be to professionals and subsequently charged users for participation. Cook&Chat allows anyone to host and post from anywhere, free of cost.

- Offering numerous ways for users to create and interact with the latest content and different people.

- Creating an intuitive way for users to learn about cultures around the world with the globe interface.

- Emphasizing community building and interpersonal understanding without many barriers to entry.

**Weaknesses:**

- The success of the web app depends on the willingness of the initial users to post and interact with others on the platform. Otherwise, there will not be much content to draw others in.

- The safety of the platform relies on the goodwill of the users to create an inclusive and welcoming environment when using the web app.

**Opportunities:**

- Some users are dissatisfied with the clunky third-party video conferencing of our competitors.

- Users are unhappy with the unreliable quality of traditional recipe websites.

- Employers are seeking creative ways to bridge intercultural divides and foster a more inclusive and tight-knit work culture.

- Online platforms continue to be the primary way that people learn about and interact with diverse groups of people.

**Threats:**

- The prominence and number of our competitors make it difficult to break into a specific market. Larger players can easily replicate our platform and more easily recruit our target audience.

- Strong local connections are necessary to gain traction across diverse communities.

- Users with vast culinary knowledge may just be lured by the pay provided by other competitors instead of our “LettuceMeet” video conferencing.

## Future opportunities

**Expand**

- Don’t just include food, but maybe we can add clothes, traditions, etc...

- Incorporate an in-person meet up feature where people can “match” based on proximity or culinary interest to either cook together or try an authentic local restaurant.

- Create a “reels” feature for uploading video tutorials for users’ recipes.

- Make it desktop compatible! PC users are currently not in-scope.

**Export goods**

- A place where people can sell food products or send samples

- Commercialize by partnering with food delivery services (Blue Apron, HelloFresh, etc.) to deliver specialty ingredients to customers previously lacking access to them.

- Connect with employers to use our platform for workplace bonding/cooking events.
